Parameter estimation for latent variable models is typically
  performed by optimizing the log-likelihood, which is prone to local
  optima due to its non-convexity. 
In this paper, we extend recent advances in the method of moments 
  to provide consistent parameter estimates for a general family of
  directed and undirected graphical models, including grid models
  (\figureref{approach}) and latent tree models.
The key idea in our approach is that, given the observation potentials
  between observed and latent variables, the marginal distribution of
  every clique is recoverable from the corresponding partial moments.
We characterize the polynomial sample complexity for models in this
  family.
For models outside our family, we show how our approach can constrain
  parameter search by providing partial information via posterior
  regularization. 
Finally, we provide empirical intuition via experiments.
