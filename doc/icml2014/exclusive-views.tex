\subsection{\lemmaref{lem:bottleneck-views}}
\label{app:exclusive-views}

In \sectionref{directed}, we stated that bottlenecks guaranteed
  exclusive views. We provide the proof below.
\begin{lemma*}[Bottlenecks guarantee exclusive views]
  %\label{lem:bottleneck-views}  
Let $\sG' = \{ h_{i_1}, \cdots, h_{i_m} \} \subseteq \sG$ be
  a connected sub-graph of hidden variables. If every hidden variable
  $h_i \in \sG'$ is a bottleneck, then they have an exclusive view.
\end{lemma*}
\begin{proof}
  By \lemmaref{reduction}, we can assume that every observed
  variable is a leaf in the graph, causing any v-structures in the graph
  to be active. This allows us to reason about independence simply by
  checking whether or not two nodes are connected or not. Note that this
  proof applies for undirected graphs as well.

  Let $h$ be a hidden variable in $\sG'$, let $\sV_{h}$ be the set of
  views for it and let ${\sG'}^- \eqdef \sG' \setminus \{h\}$.
  By definition, the views of $h$ are conditionally independent, viz.
    every connecting path between two views $x_1, x_2 \in \sV_h$ must pass through
    $h$.
  A view $x \in \sV_{h}$ is exclusive for $h$ iff $x \not\in \sV_{h'} ~ \forall h'
  \in {\sG'}^-$.

  Suppose $h$ had no unique view, then $\sV_{h} \subseteq \Union_{h' \in {\sG'}^-} \sV_{h'}$. 
  However, this would imply that for every $x_1, x_2 \in \sV_{h}$, there
  exists some $h_1, h_2 \in {\sG'}^-$ (not necessarily distinct) such that
    $x_1$ is connected to $h_1$ and $x_2$ is connected to $h_2$.
  By participation in the sub-graph, either $h_1 = h_2$ or $h_1$ is
    connected to $h_2$, implying that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are connected
    via a path that does not pass through $h$, contradicting the
    statement that $x_1, x_2 \in \sV_h$. 
    
  Thus, it must be the case that $\sV_{h} \nsubseteq \Union_{h' \neq
    h \in \sG'} \sV_{h'}$ and hence there exists a unique view for $h$.

  Algorithmically, finding the unique view for $h$ can be done by
  subtracting the views of all other variables in the sub-graph from
  $\sV_h$,i.e. $x_{v_h} \in \sV_h \setminus \Union_{h' \in \sG'} \sV_{h'}$
\end{proof}
