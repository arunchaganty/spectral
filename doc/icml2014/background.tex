\paragraph{Bottlenecks: Three-view mixture models}

\citet{anandkumar12moments} present an algorithm to solve three-view mixture models.

Assume means $M_1, M_2, M_3$. Observe that the moments of the model are $M_{123}$.

Applying a whitening transformation and get a orthogonal tensor decomposition.

Solved using the robust tensor power method \citet{anandkumar13tensor}.
