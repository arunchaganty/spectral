\section{Method of Moments}

\subsection{Identifiability}

The model is in general identifiable, except for a pathological case
with how data points are placed.

Plot of the above scenario.

Interesting question; how do these extend in the non-linear case (which
would be ``new'').

Linear independence to give intuition

Quadratic and cubic independence

necessary if only get low lower moments up to $p$

Note about dependencies in the n-th moments. 

Method of moments
argue why naive thing doesn't work.

Note: we haven't shown identifiability from all moments.

\subsection{Algorithm}

If knew $M_2$ and $M_3$, then can use existing techniques.

We can do low-rank regression to recover $M_2$ and $M_3$.

An overview of the algorithm is as follows; use low-rank/ridge regression
recovery techniques to recover the $B$ and $\mathcal{B}$ from moments of the
data. Use the tensor factorization to recover the $\pi$, $\beta$ which are
eigenvalues/eigenvectors.

\subsection{Recovering $B$ and $\mathcal{B}$}

Writing out the regression problem.

\begin{lemma}
  Recovery analysis of ridge regression is $\le \Omega(\frac{d^2}{n})$.
  Try and figure out dependence on condition numbers. It's similarly
  $\le \Omega(\frac{d^3}{n})$.
\end{lemma}

\end{proof}

Using low-rank gradient methods. Overview SVD for

  Recovery analysis of nuclear-norm regression is $\le
  \Omega(\frac{kd}{n})$. Try and figure out dependence on condition
  numbers.
\end{lemma}

  Theorem Y \cite{Tomioka2011}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Recovering Regression Coefficients}

Write out the form of $B$ and $\mathcal{B}$ in symmetric tensor form.

Use Tensor Power Method to recovery $\beta_k$.

  Bound error in the $\beta$ based on the errors of $B$ and $\mathcal{B}$.
