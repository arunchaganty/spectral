\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We evaluated our algorithm on 20 different examples of a domain Y.

Mixture of linear regressions, 

linear 
quadratic
``motion tracking data''

tensor power method get better results?

Point: spectral offers a good initialization to EM by finding directions which
are far apart.
