\subsection{Tensor Factorization}
\label{sec:tensor-power}

Write out the form of $B$ and $\mathcal{B}$ in symmetric tensor form.

Use Tensor Power Method to recovery $\beta_k$.

\begin{lemma}
  Let $\hat T = T + E$, where $T$ is a symmetric tensor with orthogonal decomposition $T = \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i v_i\tp{3}$ and each $\lambda_i > 0$. If 
  \begin{align}
    \epsilon &\le O(\frac{\lambda_{min}}{k}) \\
    N &\ge O(\log(k) + \log \log(\frac{ \lambda_{max} }{\epsilon} ), 
  \end{align}
  and for $L = O( poly(k) \log(\frac{1/\eta}) )$  attempts, then with
  probability atleast $1 - \eta$, there exists a permutation $\pi$ on
  $[k]$ such that,
  \begin{align}
    \|v_{\pi(j)} - \hat v_j\| &\le 8 \epsilon/\lambda_{\pi(j)} \\
    \|\lambda_{\pi(j)} - \hat \lambda_j\| &\le 5 \epsilon.
  \end{align}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\todo{ This only gives us the eigenvectors for an orthogonal
decomposition. We also need to work out the darned coefficients
whitening the tensor adds.  Namely, what is $\delta T(W,W,W)$ (for which
the above bound applies), given $\delta W$ and ultimately $\delta P$
($W^T P W = I$). These calculations can be found in the notes I had had
earlier.}
