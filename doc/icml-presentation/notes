* Gen vs Disc. graphical model. (*)
* HMMs, GMMs, etc. (*)

* MLE is consistent. EM is not.  (*)
* Get rid of applications nonsense (*)

* MoM the big picture, i.e. /talks/2013/microsoft/ (~)
* Cite the new result in 2009,  (~)
  * Outline the high level idea of tensor factorization (-symmetric).
  * move the tensor factorization to mom. (*)
  * Let's see how we can apply this building block to our scenario. (*)
* -unmixing
* -mom
* -unweidly stuff .
* one slide for y = ...
* diagrmas for y = x . M_p
* Warm up with M1 and M2
* regression just for y3.
  + Error analysis for just M3
* EM for just 1
* Compared to observable operator 
  - animations.
  - histogram
  - revisit the optimaization picture.

* Get clear the difference between discriminative and generative models.
