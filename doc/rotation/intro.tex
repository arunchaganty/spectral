\begin{itemize}
\item Problems with Expectation-Maximisation: Convergence and optima
\item Problems with Pearson's method: Requires moments of the order of the parameters in the problem.
\item Requires some rank assumptions and also availability of multiple views
\item Multivariate Gaussians when means are sufficiently separated - $d^c \sigma$.
\item Spectral projection
\item Note; Non-redundancy is important - else singlarity!
\end{itemize}
