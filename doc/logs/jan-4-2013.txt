I spent a couple of hours tweaking the spectral HMM recovery code. As of
yesterday, it worked reliably only when the number of dimensions was small, and
was very sensitive to the random features chosen. On changing the scheme I used
from Gaussian random variables to uniform on the unit hypercube, the performance
did seem to improve for smaller parameter ranges. 

As a simple experiment, I ran the recovery algorithm 10 times on data generated
from a HMM with 2 hidden states, 100 emission types which were projected
randomly onto 20 dimensions. In some of the cases, the Gaussian white noise with
$\sigma^2 = 0.1$ was added to the observations.

Table: HMM Recovery Errors.

The following configurations errored out due to complex eigenvalues with both
uniform and Gaussian random features, as well as with clean and noisy data, 
$(K, E, D) \in 10 \times \{10, 50, 100} \times {10, 20}.$

The unfortunate result is that it seems like the recovery error is too
significant to be ignored.
