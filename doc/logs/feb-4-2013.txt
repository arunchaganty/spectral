I spent the day plotting the lines fit by EM across iterations. The
initialization given by spectral are very interesting; they pull the curves far
apart from each other, and prevent EM from falling into local minima.

Percy and I met to discuss these curves; they are interesting enough I think to
find a place in our paper. Next on our agenda, in terms of priority are,

#. Writing!
#. Tensor power method.
#. Is recovering $B^{\otimes}$ using the trace method is important.
#. What is the relation to K-Means++.
#. Experiments over a "motion" dataset.

It's hardly a week to deadline! Move move move!
