We briefly met to discuss some of the results. We have several examples where
"spectral + EM" performs more reliably than EM does - and the nature of getting
closer to the global minima for EM is very apparent. The next step, in Percy's
perspective, is to be able to clearly show this relation between EM and
spectral, which is certainly a very interesting contribution. I hope to get some
tantalizing graphs soon.

Over the past few days, we tried figuring out a good "monomial" basis set. It
was quickly apparent that the behaviour of the Fourier series was no better than
polynomials (which arguably is to be expected, given their dual nature). It
wasn't such a difficult job to generate them ourselves of course.

Random fractionals are much worse conditioned than the polynomials (to be
expected). The hyper-surfaces for the "cubically independent" monomials was
quite interesting.
