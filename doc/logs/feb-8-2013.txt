I hacked together something in python to test how good the low-rank recovery
techniques do in recovery the answer. As a sanity check, it returns the same
result when $\lambda = 0$. Expectedly, the improvement is slight in the pairs
case, and relatively marked in the tensor case. On the positive side, it's also
better in the absolute sense. For tensors, some figures follow,

Ridge Regression    Low-rank
5.24662568659       0.71176336
0.127070577963      0.166285040282
11.8803871954       8.60234416936
10.4856481712       3.26391827592

Clearly, things aren't perfect and we might have to do some parameter search to
improve.

Later in the evening, Percy and I tried to sketch out the paper outline. We
brought up some points about the variance, etc. which need to be worked out in
detail.
