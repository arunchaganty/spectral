# Agenda

We discussed the upcoming agenda for the project which we are targeting for the
ICML February deadline. 

Our main contributions will be:

#. An algorithm for a mixture of linear regressions.
    #. We should be able to integrate with the tensor power up method and also
    sneak in the $\eta$ into the recovery step.
#. Matrix perturbation based sample complexity results.
#. A first order asymptotic analysis. 
#. Experiments on "real" and simulated data.

Some possible additions that would be interesting to include:

#. A joint optimization of the tensor power up method and regression.
#. Applications to cases where $h$ depends on $x$; i.e. basically non-smooth
   intersections, etc.

It will be important for this purpose that we do the following before the end of the winter break:

#. Experiments on various simulated and real regimes.
#. Handle input noise robustly.
#. Scale to the order of a 100 dimensions reliably.
#. Have an implementation setup to work on "real" datasets.
