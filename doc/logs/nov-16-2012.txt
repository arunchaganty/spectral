Experiments
------------

* Brown clustering is still clustering
* Issue: the random projection matrix fails when the number of word types
  grows out of hand.
  + Solution: Use seeds or cluster words that occur very infrequently into
    word types (digits, lowercase, uppercase, others)
* Goal: Build table of (Brown, EM, Spectral) vs (Fake-NYT-15, Fake-NYT-42,
  NYT-42, NYT-100, NYT-500, NYT-1000)
* Using fig to keep track of experiments.

Mixture of Linear Regressions (Independent Case)
------------------------------------------------

* The model is $y = \sum_i P(h_i) P(y|x,h)$ where $P(h_i)$ is fixed
  multinomial and $P(y|x,h) = \beta_i^T x + \varepsilon$.
* The moments have the following form:
  $E[ Y^k X ] = X^{\otimes k+1} (\sum_i \pi_i \beta_i^{\otimes k})$
* If we can factor out the $X^{\otimes k+1}$ by some higher generalisation of
  whitening, we can solve for $\beta_i$ by projecting $\beta_i^{\otimes 3}$ onto
  an orthonormal basis $\Theta$.

Mixture of Linear Regressions (Dependent Case)
------------------------------------------------

* The model is $y = \sum_i P(h_i) P(x|h_i) P(y|x,h)$ where $P(x|h_i)$ is
  $\normal{\mu_i}{\sigma^2}$ multinomial and 
  $P(y|x,h) = \beta_i^T x + \varepsilon$.
* This looks like an interesting case and worth looking at after the above
  scenario.

Meta-discussion
---------------

* We have about 3-4 weeks left.
