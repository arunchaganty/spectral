On the use of Dirichlets
------------------------

I ran some experiments to look at the performance of the Dirichlet generation of
$q(x)$ across varying $\alpha$. The graphs conclusively showed that it was
extremely poor at recovering $\beta_i$, but we were confused as to why that was
the case.

~~~~~~ {.python}
def test_dirichlet():
    K, d, N = 2, 3, 1000

    # Initialise a model
    lrm = LinearRegressionsMixture.generate(tempfile.mktemp(), K, d, cov = "eye", betas="eye")
    M, S, pi, B = lrm.mean, lrm.sigma, lrm.weights, lrm.betas

    # Compute exact moments
    B2 = B.dot( diag( pi ) ).dot( B.T )

    # Generate some samples
    y, X = lrm.sample( N )

    indices = sc.triu_indices( d )
    d_ = (d * (d+1) / 2) 

    # Reweighting for a bunch of points
    alpha = 1.0
    Q = dirichlet( alpha * ones( N ), d_ )

    Y = Q.dot(y**2)
    Theta = zeros( (d_, d_) )
    for i in xrange( n ):
        Theta[i,:] = PairsQ(X, Q[i])[indices]

    Theta_inv = inv( Theta )
    B2_indices = Theta_inv.dot( Y )

    B2_ = zeros( (d, d) )
    B2_[indices] = B2_indices
    B2_ = (B2_ + B2_.T)/2

    print norm(B2 - B2_)
~~~~~~

Stepping through the algorithm, I realised that two things were culprit, 

(a) The source of sampling noise comes from the averaging of the different
$\beta_i$. When $\alpha$ is too small, we choose only a handful of $x$,
increasing the sampling noise, leading to terrible estimates. This confirms the
intuition about why the local Gaussians worked - they would average over the
different $x$ in a region which statistically would have sufficiently many
choices of $h$, leading to good estimates of $B = \sum_i \pi_i \beta_i
\beta_i^T$.
(b) When $\alpha$ is larger, the matrix $S$ with rows $vec(\E_q[ x x^T ])$ is
very poorly conditioned and the small sampling noise is amplified when $S$ is
inverted. Using more samples of $q$ and regularising the matrix helped but only
marginally.

It is interesting that these two factors compensate for each other to give
uniformly terrible estimates. The final conclusion seems to be that Dirichlets
are not a suitable class of priors of $q$ for this problem.

We agreed to two new directions, playing around more with the locally weighted
Gaussians and choosing subsets of the points.
