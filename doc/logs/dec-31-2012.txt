The last few days have been slow on account of various break-related factors.

Some status updates:

* I've spent some time empirically looking at the role of the Q's in the
  problem. It looks fairly random, but I'll need to see all the data to come to
  a concrete conclusion.
* The moment computations for the data with the smallest number of dimensions is
  finally complete.
* I've debugged and tested the Java version of Algorithm B. It seems to fail
  with imaginary eigenvalues on large number of clusters. I need to tease out
  whether this is a numerical issue or simply due to too small spectral values
  in the tail?
