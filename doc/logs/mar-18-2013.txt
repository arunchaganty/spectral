We spoke about various projects

## Directions forward for spectral methods

i) Clean up the ICML submission, in particular,
  a) Avoid the excessive $d$'s cropping up in the analysis
  b) Include the more detailed analysis for the algorithm including whitening (*)
  c) Redo some of the experiments to get more robust results (might take more
  than this week).
ii) An asymptotic study, which involves computed the Jacobian of the moment map.
iii) How might we derive predictive algorithms for spectral techniques? These
would not be troubled by (model) non-identifiability and we might get better
bounds.
iv) Can we "regularize" the estimator?
v) Handling model mis-specification / the strength of bounds.

## Program Analysis for Machine Learning

* We could probably handle spectral algorithms and online learning / ERM
  + Immediate horizon - maybe I could write a parser?

## Distantly Supervised via Logic

* Still too hard of a problem. Consider deferring.
* What is a suitable logic? Natural logic? (MacCartney and Manning; Natural
  Logic for Textual Inference; ACL 2007)

## Vague jottings

* I should look at the Newton polytope I had read about in the algebraic
  statistics paper. It seems like there is some 
* My first priority is to find a research direction.
