To handle noise, all that was needed to be done was to add the appropriate bias
term to the convexified optimization problem,
\begin{eqnarray}
  \min && \frac{1}{2} \sum ( y^2 - x^T B x - \sigma ) + \trace{B} \\
  \textrm{subject to} && B \ge 0 \\
                      && \sigma \ge 0.
\end{eqnarray}

I set up scripts to see how well this performed; they take a while to run
though. Towards the latter part of the day, I experimented with CVX on Matlab.
