Algorithm for fixed $P(h|x)$
============================

We make the following assumptions:

#. $\beta$ is a full-rank $d \times k$ matrix.
#. $\pi$ is fixed, though unknown and positive.
#. $X \sim \normal{\mu}{\Sigma}$.

Then, informally, our algorithm is:

#. Center and whiten $X$.
#. Generate $\Sigma_i \sim Wishart(d,I)$, and define $q_i = \normal{0}{\Sigma_i}$.
#. Compute $M_2 = (M_{21}, ..., M_{2d'})$ where $M_{2i} = \E_{q_i}[ y^2 ]$ for $0 \le i \le \frac{d (d-1)}{2} = d'$. 
#. Compute $S = [\triu(\Sigma_1) | \cdots | \triu(\Sigma_n)]$ and then, the off
   diagonal elements of $B_2 = \beta \diag(\pi) \beta^T$ are $S^{-1} M_2/2$ (because the matrix is symmetric) and
   the diagonal elements are $S^{-1} M_2$.
#. Similarly, compute $B^3(U^T \theta)$. *NOTE:* We might run into a bottleneck
   with the third moments of the Gaussian being $0$.
#. Use $B_2$ to "whiten" $B^3$, allowing us to read off $\beta^T U^T \theta$ by looking at the singular values.
#. Adjust $\beta$ by inverting $U^T \Theta$, unwhitening and finally uncentering.

There is still a lingering issue that we are obviously not using the data as
effectively as possible - we should only need $d k$ samples of $q$, since that
is how many parameters there really are.

Recovering $y = \|x\|_1$
========================

This runs into an issue that the number of lines implicitly defined in this
distribution $k$ is $2^d > d$, so our technique described above doesn't work,
since the rank is $\le d < k$.

Relaxing the distribution over X
================================

In the algorithm above, we make the assumption that $X$ is Gaussian to adjust
the distribution with $q$. One way we could relax this whole setup is to
arbitrarily reweigh the _observed points_ according to some $w(x) ~ Dirichlet(\alpha)$. 
The distribution of $q$ is then a sample from a _Dirichlet process_ with base distribution
$p(x)$ (in the limit atleast).

We could use the mean "measure" of the DP to calculate the inverse transforms we
need to effect to recover our desired moments.


Todo Items
==========

#. Instrument the experiments to try and find out why they are taking as long as
   they are.
#. Study the properties of the Dirichlet process and try to compute the means,
   etc.
#. Work out the factors when there is some noise present.
