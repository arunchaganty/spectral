After the ICML submission, Percy talked about a problem that might(?) be
interesting, $p(y|X) = \sigma( \langle (yX)^{\otimes}, M_2 \rangle )$, only that
$M_2$ is low rank. Something like a convex neural network.

Why is this interesting?

Much later, I've learned that the discussion was about how we might be able to
use a quadratic function (as a very very rough approximation to a sigmoid), with
an appropriate regularizer.
