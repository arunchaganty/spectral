I am reconstructing this diary entry from memory, so it is unfortunately only partially complete.

Status of Experiments
=====================

I revisited my multi-view Gaussian code to find that there seems to be some
bugs. It works well when the means are well separated, but for random means it
fails on some particular entries. I will need to slowly test the functions
from scratch.

The New Algorithm
=================

I found that the new algorithm of using a Dirichlet over points failed to
work. Working incrementally by testing this on finite distributions, which did
work lead me to conjecture that it was failing because we didn't have enough
samples to converge as the proposal $q(x)$ was quite non-smooth when using the
Dirichlet. 

Instead of using a Dirichlet, I used something like a radial-basis function
$q(x) = \exp(\|x-x_0\|)$ and this worked perfectly fine. 

Meeting Percy, we set an agenda to do the following:

#. Run the algorithm with some simple standard data
#. Experiment with simpler $q(x)$ functions.
