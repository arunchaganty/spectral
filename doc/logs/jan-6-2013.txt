I replicated the mixture of linear regressions experiments using `CVX` and started
scripts for them as well.

# Handling non-linearities

Applying the kernel trick seems to be a hard nut to crack unless the spectral
recovery of $B$ was rolled into process. The chief problem being that the
dimensionality of $\beta \otimes \beta$ explodes with non-trivial kernels.

I modified the existing mixture of linear regressions in a very ad-hoc manner to
recover the $\beta$; the recovery of $\beta^{\otimes 2}$ and $\beta^{\otimes 3}$
was much more sensitive (the condition numbers were also significantly larger),
but the recovery did work. The theory we have so far doesn't really extend to
this regime, and it would be interesting to investigate exactly where it breaks
down. And, of course, whether we could provide results of our own.

I set up experiments (on `corn04` and `corn11`) to check how well the recovery
truly worked when the data was non-linear for different $K$ and $D$.
