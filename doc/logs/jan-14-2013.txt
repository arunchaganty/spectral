Percy and I met to discuss progress and make another attempt at recovering
$\eta^T B$. The remainder term I pointed out earlier seems to have a constant
bias that could be computed without too much effort. It seems like it would be
more worthwhile to actually run some experiments on the data to test how well it
could work.

# Agenda

#. Run experiments to try and recover $\eta^T B$ using the 
   $\eta^T B x = (\eta^T x) y + \sigma$ argument.
#. By Thursday, write a skeleton draft of the paper with suitable proof lemmas.
#. By Thursday, run some experiments with EM, spectral and spectral+EM on the
   non-linear data.

# General plan for experiments

We'd like to work with three different datasets,

#. Gaussian data - it is clean, we can compute the expectations and measure how
   the empirical quantities relate to the theoretical ones. The crux lies in
   finding something that EM does poorly on.
#. Non-linear curves 
#. Motion Tracking data

In all these cases, we'd like to vary $n$, $d$, $k$, $\sigma^2$ and the
separation of the $\beta$.
